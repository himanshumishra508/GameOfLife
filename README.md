# Game Of Life
The Game of Life (an example of a cellular automaton) is played on an infinite two-dimensional rectangular grid of cells. Each cell can be either alive or dead. The status of each cell changes each turn of the game (also called a generation) depending on the statuses of that cell's 8 neighbors. Neighbors of a cell are cells that touch that cell, either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal from that cell.

Conway's Game Of Life is a Cellular Automation Method created by John Horton Conway. This game was created with Biology in mind but has been applied in various fields such as Graphics, terrain generation, etc.
